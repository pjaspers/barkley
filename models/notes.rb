 In 2019 he finished Loop 3 and started Loop 4 (him and Karel Sabbe were the only to do so, but only had 12 hours to complete it), but came back some time later.

  In 2022 he made it to Loop 4, before timing out in that loop.

 :clarke => <<~NOTES,
From his Strava bio:

<blockquote>Ultra runner with two primary aspirational goals in the sport: 1) win more ultramarathons outright against all competition (won my 1st at The Last Annual Heart of the South, aka HOTS, in June 2022), and 2) complete at least a Fun Run (3 loops) within 40 hours at the Barkley Marathons.</blockquote>

Has ran the Barkley Fall Classic a couple of times and has finished MOAB multiple times.

  Previous attempts in 2023, 2021,2016,2014,2013 and 201212 (finished in 16, 14 and 12, fun run in 21, fun run in 23)

  <blockquote>To put it lightly, Jared Campbell is a prolific, inspirational, and ingenious endurance athlete and environmentalist. Among his accomplishments, Campbell is the sole three-time finisher of the Barkley Marathons, he founded a trail running event that supports clean-air initiatives, and he has rebuilt a home to be net positive and teaches others how to do it affordably, too. If it were not for his humility, perhaps more people would know the breadth of Campbellâ€™s philanthropic climate work, as well as his self-blueprinted adventures.</blockquote>
