  <blockquote>To put it lightly, Jared Campbell is a prolific, inspirational, and ingenious endurance athlete and environmentalist. Among his accomplishments, Campbell is the sole three-time finisher of the Barkley Marathons, he founded a trail running event that supports clean-air initiatives, and he has rebuilt a home to be net positive and teaches others how to do it affordably, too. If it were not for his humility, perhaps more people would know the breadth of Campbellâ€™s philanthropic climate work, as well as his self-blueprinted adventures.</blockquote>
