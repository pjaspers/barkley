  <blockquote>Ultra runner with two primary aspirational goals in the sport: 1) win
  more ultramarathons outright against all competition (won my 1st at The Last Annual
  Heart of the South, aka HOTS, in June 2022), and 2) complete at least a Fun Run
  (3 loops) within 40 hours at the Barkley Marathons.</blockquote>


  Has ran the Barkley Fall Classic a couple of times and has finished MOAB multiple
  times.
