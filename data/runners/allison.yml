notes: |
  I started running around 2013 and quickly fell in love with it as a way to reconnect with my body, work through difficult emotions, and just have fun outside! My first race in 2018 was the Bizz Johnson 50k.The bug quickly took hold and I’ve raced 50 mile, 100k, 100 mile, and 200+ miles! I am grateful to my own coaches for giving me the training and experience to perform well at many of these events (highlights: Divide 200, first place, Bigfoot 200, 3rd place, under previous course record, Leona Divide 100k, first place, course record, Tushars 100k, 2nd place) With a love of sharing knowledge and a hunger to inspire more women to get on the trails, it was a natural next step for me to become a coach and give back to the community. I completed my UESCA Ultra Running Coach certification and launched To Be Running. I thrive on helping others achieve their dreams!
