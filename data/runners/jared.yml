  <blockquote>To put it lightly, Jared Campbell is a prolific, inspirational, and
  ingenious endurance athlete and environmentalist. Among his accomplishments, Campbell
  is the sole three-time finisher of the Barkley Marathons, he founded a trail running
  event that supports clean-air initiatives, and he has rebuilt a home to be net positive
  and teaches others how to do it affordably, too. If it were not for his humility,
  perhaps more people would know the breadth of Campbell’s philanthropic climate work,
  as well as his self-blueprinted adventures.</blockquote>
