notes: |
  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rogaining_Championships">World Rogaining Champion</a> in 2016 and 2017 (Also see <a href="/r/albert">Albert</a>) so you know he can navigate.

  In 2019 he finished Loop 3 and started Loop 4 (him and Karel Sabbe were the only to do so, but only had 12 hours to complete it), but came back some time later.

  In 2022 he made it to Loop 4, before timing out in that loop.
