Mathieu: he won the Fall Classic so was an auto invite; anecdotally had been seen there.

Two French Guys have finished loop 1 in 10:07:46 and 10:08:10, one of whom stopped to put trash bags over his shoes prior to crossing the creek. 🤦‍♂️ #BM100

A Pale Guy and Happy Guy with Red Shirt finished loop 1 in 10:40:27 and :29. #BM100

Happy Guy with Red Shirt changed his shirt for loop 2, so not quite sure who he is now.  But in any event there are now eight runners on loop 2, with a ninth to follow soon. #BM100

12:36
Two more runners, including the lead woman, have finished loop 1; at the same time, two other runners returned to camp from the wrong direction and are tapped out. #BM100
10:40 + 52 => 11:38


12:54
Another runner has finished loop 1 while at the same time the first woman begins loop 2.  10 runners are on loop 2, 2 are in camp, 3 have quit.  Runners have less than 30 minutes to complete loop 1 and be out on loop 2. #BM100
11:38 + 18 => 11:56

1:03
A runner booped the gate to begin loop 2.  So far 12 in, 12 out. #BM100
