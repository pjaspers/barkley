The conch was blown at 5:00am.  The 2026 Barkley Marathons begins in one hour. #BM100



Mathieu: he won the Fall Classic so was an auto invite; anecdotally had been seen there.

Iain Bethune, All the kit matches - same jacket, same backpack. So yeah, looks like he's in #bm100
https://bsky.app/profile/alixwzl.bsky.social/post/3metkk5x5ck2u

Chiseled Jaw Guy, Knee Guy, Old Guy, Midnight guy, and The Path Finder are the first five in
https://bsky.app/profile/keithdunn.bsky.social/post/3metvte5vpc2q

The first five runners have finished loop one in 9:47:08
https://bsky.app/profile/keithdunn.bsky.social/post/3metvso47oc2q

Old French Guy does a 9:22 turnaround and is the first to begin loop 2, followed quickly by three more runners. #BM100
https://bsky.app/profile/keithdunn.bsky.social/post/3metw36vark2q

Knee Guy has begun loop 2. Five runners are on loop two; 35 runners are on loop 1. #BM100
https://bsky.app/profile/keithdunn.bsky.social/post/3metwbvjxm224

Two French Guys have finished loop 1 in 10:07:46 and 10:08:10, one of whom stopped to put trash bags over his shoes prior to crossing the creek. 🤦‍♂️ #BM100

11:44
A Pale Guy and Happy Guy with Red Shirt finished loop 1 in 10:40:27 and :29. #BM100
https://bsky.app/profile/keithdunn.bsky.social/post/3metyyrw5xc2p

Happy Guy with Red Shirt changed his shirt for loop 2, so not quite sure who he is now.  But in any event there are now eight runners on loop 2, with a ninth to follow soon. #BM100

12:36
Two more runners, including the lead woman, have finished loop 1; at the same time, two other runners returned to camp from the wrong direction and are tapped out. #BM100
10:40 + 52 => 11:38


12:54
Another runner has finished loop 1 while at the same time the first woman begins loop 2.  10 runners are on loop 2, 2 are in camp, 3 have quit.  Runners have less than 30 minutes to complete loop 1 and be out on loop 2. #BM100
11:38 + 18 => 11:56

1:03
A runner booped the gate to begin loop 2.  So far 12 in, 12 out. #BM100
https://bsky.app/profile/keithdunn.bsky.social/post/3meuadffwsk2k
11:56 + 8 => 12:04


1 DNF
We have had our first loop 2 runner drop out of the race. 11 runners remain on loop 2; 7 runners are still on loop 1 (well over the time limit). #BM100

And then there were ten on loop 2. #BM100

3 DNF
A French runner has been tapped out. Nine runners remain on loop 2. #BM100

5 DNF
The first loop 2 finishers: Sébastien Raichon in 22:35:40; Mathieu Blanchard :42; Damian Hall :44.
At the same time, another loop 2 runner has quit and is tapped out.  #BM100
https://bsky.app/profile/keithdunn.bsky.social/post/3mevanbcj2k2o


Damian Hall began loop 3 barefoot at 22:54:26. Mathieu Blanchard and Sébastien Raichon began loop 3 shortly thereafter.  #BM100

I had John Kelly and potentially Knee Guy, given his knee injury
curtailing his Spine a month ago. If he was in the first group on loop
one and wasn't on loop two then I like that even more (I mean I also
really don't like that as it could indicate that the injury proved to
be an issue)

Max King finished loop 2 in 24:06:38. #BM100
https://bsky.app/profile/keithdunn.bsky.social/post/3mevflrb3oc2y

Max King begins loop 3 wearing plastic bags around his feet in 25:42:12. #BM100
https://bsky.app/profile/keithdunn.bsky.social/post/3mevkx2rsrk2w


26 hours into the #BM100 4 runners are on loop 3, 3 runners are on loop 2, and 5 runners are in loop 1.  Runners currently on loop 2 must begin loop 3 by 26:40 in order to continue. #BM100
https://bsky.app/profile/keithdunn.bsky.social/post/3mevpdonk2k2n


Mathieu Blanchard quit on loop 3 due to cold and is tapped out.  #BM100
https://bsky.app/profile/keithdunn.bsky.social/post/3mew4nirbmc2r


I must have dozed off or something, but somehow I missed Max King dropping a couple hours ago, after making it to book 4 on loop 3. Two runners remain on loop 3; 1 remains on loop 1. #BM100
https://bsky.app/profile/keithdunn.bsky.social/post/3mew7i35yls2o


Sébastien Raichon finished loop 3 in 38:05:46 and is credited with a Fun Run. #BM100
https://bsky.app/profile/keithdunn.bsky.social/post/3mewucaxw3s2t


Damian Hall came in off loop 3, but without collecting all his pages and is the last to face the bugler.  Fog, cold, and the wet weather were factors. #BM100
